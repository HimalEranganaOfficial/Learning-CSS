This is the first version of my personal Portfolio site.

Technologies I used to this project;
1. HTML5
2. CSS3

This is an Un-finished ptoject. I faced some performance issues with this site because, I put lots of CSS animations there and rendering them was a hard thing to do for low-end PCs.

And, I discovered about CSS Scroll-Driven animations and I wanted to use in a new project.
